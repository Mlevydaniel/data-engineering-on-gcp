Add static IP address

1) Create or turn on dataproc cluster
2) Enter to dataproc cluster instance
3) Go to VM Instance tab
4) Choose master node instance
5) In Network interfaces click on View details of master node instance
6) On the menu at the left, click on Ip Addresses
7) Attach Static IP Address clicking on Change button and select the master instance. This will assign the static ip address to the master vm instance of the cluster

Connect to gcloud dataproc

1. Configure gcloud connection

1) run `gcloud compute config-ssh`
2) execute command suggested by gcloud to connect, example: `ssh cluster-3fb9-m.us-central1-f.dataanalytics-347914`

2. Use ssh command from vm instance. This will create a new ssh keys to connect

1) gcloud compute ssh --zone "us-central1-f" "cluster-3fb9-m" --project "dataanalytics-347914"
2) connect using ssh command `ssh -i ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine mlevydaniel@34.122.45.243`

Important note: In case it appears a warning message remove the existing RSA key from the known_hosts file in ssh folder: https://serverfault.com/questions/321167/add-correct-host-key-in-known-hosts-multiple-ssh-host-keys-per-hostname

Connect using VScode

1) Download "Remote - SSH extension" developed by Microsoft
2) ssh config file needs to include the cluster instance information. Using `gcloud compute config-ssh` command will do all the configuration automatically

ssh config file stores different ssh configurations to access each key easily. For example, using only `ssh hostname` will connect without any other parameter

3) connect to host and clone repository: https://github.com/Mlevydaniel/data-engineering-on-gcp.git
